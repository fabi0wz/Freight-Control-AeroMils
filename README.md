# Avião Charter System

![Project Logo](add_your_project_logo_url_here)

This project, developed in C# with Windows Forms, is an Freight Control System designed to manage and facilitate the chartering of airplanes. The system is the collaborative effort of two full stack development students enrolled in a course on Programming of Information Systems and Technologies.

## Features asked in our exam:

### Class: Empresa
- Contains a list of Planes.

### Windows Forms Interface
The application provides a user-friendly interface with the following options:

a. **Insert New Plane**
   - Add a new airplane of any type to the system.

b. **Change Plane Status**
   - Modify the status of a specific Avião.

c. **View Available Plane for Flight**
   - Filter Planes by type and display available ones based on the current date.

d. **View Planes Under Maintenance**
   - Display a list of Aviões currently undergoing maintenance.

e. **Calculate Freight Price**
   - Calculate the freight price by specifying the start and end date, along with the desired Plane.

f. **Export Planes Information to CSV**
   - Export information about Aviões to a CSV file.

### Reservation System
- Implement a reservation system for Aviões.

### Calculate Total Price
- Calculate the total value between two dates according to the reservation system for all chartered Aviões.

### Simulated Date
- Provide an option to simulate the date, allowing the user to advance one day. The system checks all Aviões and displays an alert if the end date of a charter or maintenance has been reached.

## Project Status
The project is currently in progress. We have started implementing the necessary classes and interfaces for the application.
